#### Description: 
The single-page website for Snack Te Ava Iti is an elegantly simple and effective solution designed to help my mom manage her small snack/restaurant in Tahiti. This site serves as a digital menu, providing potential customers with an overview of the restaurant’s offerings, complete with tantalizing food pictures. At the top of the page, there’s a user-friendly feature: a clickable phone number. When accessed from a mobile device, this link triggers a pop-up, seamlessly redirecting the user to the phone app, making it easy for customers to call the snack for orders or inquiries. This functionality leverages the mobile-first design principle, ensuring that the website is just as accessible and functional on smartphones as it is on desktops.

A standout feature of the site is its currency conversion capability. The menu prices, originally listed in CFP francs (XPF), can be dynamically converted to other currencies like USD and EUR. This conversion is powered by the "exchangeratesapi" API, which provides up-to-date exchange rates. When a user clicks on a currency button, the prices across the menu instantly reflect the chosen currency, enhancing user convenience, especially for tourists who may not be familiar with the local currency.

At the bottom of the page, the website integrates social media and location-based services. A link to the restaurant's Facebook page allows users to explore more photos, reviews, and updates, creating a sense of community and brand loyalty. Additionally, a Google Maps link is embedded to provide precise directions to the snack, making it easier for customers to find the location.

The website is built with modern web development tools. The backend is developed using Express.js, a popular Node.js framework known for its robustness and scalability. This choice allows for efficient handling of HTTP requests and API interactions, such as fetching real-time exchange rates. On the frontend, the site utilizes the EJS (Embedded JavaScript) templating engine. EJS allows the dynamic generation of HTML, meaning that content can be tailored and displayed according to the user’s interactions—such as when they change the currency. The design is styled using Tailwind CSS, a utility-first CSS framework that promotes a clean and responsive design, ensuring that the website is visually appealing and functional across all device sizes.

One of the most important aspects of this site is its mobile-friendliness. Given the increasing reliance on mobile devices for browsing and making decisions on-the-go, the website’s responsive design ensures that users have a smooth experience regardless of whether they are using a desktop, tablet, or smartphone. The responsive design is not just about shrinking content to fit smaller screens but about reorganizing it in a way that remains user-friendly. This is evident in the way the menu items are displayed, the ease of clicking the phone number link, and how the currency conversion buttons are intuitively placed.

Moreover, the video demonstration of the application highlights its adaptability and user-oriented design. It showcases how easily users can navigate the site, convert prices, and find additional resources, all without needing to leave the page. This contributes to a seamless user experience, which is crucial for retaining potential customers and encouraging them to make contact or visit the snack.

The overall structure of the website reflects careful consideration of user experience (UX) and user interface (UI) design principles. The decision to use Express.js for the backend and EJS with Tailwind CSS for the frontend suggests a balance between performance and aesthetic appeal. The site is not overloaded with unnecessary features, which keeps it lightweight and fast, yet it includes all the necessary functionalities to serve the needs of both the restaurant and its customers.

In conclusion, the Snack Te Ava Iti website is a well-crafted digital tool that supports your mom’s business by providing an easy-to-use, mobile-friendly platform that customers can use to view the menu, make currency conversions, and connect via phone or social media. By leveraging modern web technologies like Express.js, EJS, and Tailwind CSS, the site ensures both functionality and a pleasant user experience. This approach not only helps in attracting local customers but also caters to tourists who might be unfamiliar with the local currency and need easy access to directions or additional information online.
